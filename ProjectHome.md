# What? #

A set of php5 classes to interface with the [Music Player Deamon](http://mpd.wikia.com/) (mpd).

# Why? #

There are a lot of mpd web clients out there written in PHP that use code by Benjamin Carlisle from back in 2004 (http://mpd.24oz.com/).  Despite some minor bugs, it works and is even documented.  However, there are quite a few things that I'd have wished were done differently.

Normally I'd try not to reinvent the wheel, but I just happen to have watched Joshua Bloch's excellent presentation How to Design A Good API and Why It Matters.

This small project is a somewhat impractical but educational exercise in API and OO design, specifically, for me to put into practice a few of the things that I heard so that they'll "stick."
